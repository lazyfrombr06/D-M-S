1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The Document Management System (DMS) is a web application designed to efficiently manage and organize documents. It allows users to upload text information along with related PDF files. There are two types of users in this system: Admins and Users. Admins can read, write, modify, and delete data, while Users can only read and filter data.

1.2 Scope
The DMS provides the following features:

Admin Panel with separate logins for different admins.
Admins can upload, modify, and delete documents they have uploaded.
Users can view documents and filter them.
